description: >
  Rewrites N+1 Apex (one SOQL or one DML per record) into the bulk-safe
  shape: one query per object loaded into a `Map<Id, SObject>`, in-memory
  validation via `containsKey`/`get` that preserves the per-id error
  messages, and one DML per object run after the loop. The result is a
  method whose SOQL and DML counts stay flat as the input grows — so it
  survives triggers and bulk callers instead of failing the first time it
  sees 100 records. The "should this method be bulkified?" decision lives
  in `apex-governor-limit-guard`; this skill is the rewrite recipe that
  picks up once that answer is yes, plus the measurement that proves the
  rewrite is actually O(1).

  The N+1 being removed is often a **helper call inside a loop** rather than
  a visible `[SELECT]`: a finder or an existence guard called per element
  costs one query per iteration even though the loop body shows no query at
  all. Count what the loop triggers, not what it displays.

  Use this when `apex-governor-limit-guard` flags an N+1 pattern, or when
  you are editing an existing bulk method and want to preserve or improve
  its O(1) SOQL/DML profile. Skip it for genuinely single-record
  operations and for async Batch Apex that already chunks by design. See
  `docs/deleteItems-SOQL-Optimization.docx` for the canonical
  before/after on this codebase (SOQL 49 → 26, CPU ≈ −47%, identical
  behaviour).

# Apex Bulk SOQL

Turns an N+1 pattern (one query/DML per record) into O(1) queries and DML —
independent of how many records the request carries. Numbers always come
from real bulk-safe rewrites, not estimates.

The "should I bulkify this?" decision belongs to the
[[apex-governor-limit-guard]] skill. This skill picks up after that decision
is yes, and produces the rewrite + the measurement that proves it worked.

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Rewrite into the bulk-safe form

Apply the **three rules** in order. Every bulk method must satisfy all three:

1. **One query per object type, not per record.** Collect ids into a
   `Set<Id>`, query once with `WHERE Id IN :ids` (or the relevant lookup
   field), and load the result into a `Map<Id, SObject>`. Select **every
   field** the consuming code reads, so no follow-up query is needed — but
   nothing more, so heap stays bounded.
2. **Validate and look up in memory.** Loop over the *input collection* and
   use `map.containsKey(id)` for existence and `map.get(id)` for lookups.
   This is CPU only — zero extra SOQL. It preserves per-record error
   messages (e.g. `throw new ServiceException('Item not found: ' + id)`).
3. **One DML per object type.** Build a `List<SObject>` of everything to
   write, then `update`/`insert`/`delete` the whole list once — never inside
   a loop.

Anti-pattern to detect — each `SOQL in loop` comment below marks a **call made
per element**. Only the third line is a literal query; the first two reach one
indirectly, which is exactly why the loop hides the cost:

```apex
// N+1: one SOQL per element, and/or one DML per element
for (String id : ids) {
    records.add(requireXExists(id));            // existence guard per element — SOQL in loop
}
for (X__c r : records) {
    Status__c s = findStatus(r.CurrentState__c); // finder per element      — SOQL in loop
    Parent__c p = [SELECT Id FROM Parent__c
                   WHERE Id = :r.Parent__c];     // literal query           — SOQL in loop
    update r;                                    //                           DML in loop
}
```

Bulk-safe form to write instead — one query per object, validation and lookups
in memory, one DML at the end:

```apex
// 1 query to load, in-memory validation, 1 DML to write
Map<Id, X__c> recordMap = new Map<Id, X__c>([
    SELECT Id, /* every field the downstream logic reads */
    FROM X__c
    WHERE Id IN :ids AND RecordStatus__c != 'deleted'
]);

for (Id id : ids) {                       // validate in memory, no SOQL
    if (!recordMap.containsKey(id)) {
        throw new ServiceException('X not found: ' + id);
    }
}

// resolve related records in bulk too — collect parent ids, query once:
Set<Id> stateIds = new Set<Id>();
for (X__c r : recordMap.values()) stateIds.add(r.CurrentState__c);
Map<Id, Status__c> statusMap = new Map<Id, Status__c>([
    SELECT Id, /* ... */ FROM Status__c WHERE Id IN :stateIds
]);

List<X__c> toUpdate = new List<X__c>();
for (X__c r : recordMap.values()) {
    Status__c s = statusMap.get(r.CurrentState__c); // in-memory lookup
    // ... business logic ...
    toUpdate.add(r);
}
update toUpdate;                          // single bulk DML
```

---

### Step 2 — Bulkify where the loop is

- **Rewrite the method that holds the loop.** Never move a loop somewhere else
  to "hide" it — relocating a per-element call changes nothing; the query count
  still scales with N.
- **Bulkify the helper too, not just the caller.** A helper that only accepts a
  single id leaves a bulk caller with nothing safe to call, so it gets looped
  over. Add the `Set<Id>` variant that returns a `Map<Id, SObject>`, then call
  it once.
- **A per-element existence guard becomes one bulk guard.** Replace the
  `requireXExists(id)` call inside the loop with a single bulk variant that
  loads every id at once and validates with `containsKey` in memory — the
  per-id error message is preserved.
- **Keep the load and the write on opposite sides of the loop.** Query before
  it, accumulate into a `List<SObject>` inside it, DML once after it.

### Step 3 — Hand back to the guard for verification

Once the rewrite is in place, the [[apex-governor-limit-guard]] execution
checklist is the verification step. Run it before presenting the code; if
any row fails, return to Step 1.

## Resources

### Reference rewrite

`docs/deleteItems-SOQL-Optimization.docx` — worked example of this skill
applied to `ManageItemsController.deleteItems`: SOQL **49 → 26**, CPU
**≈ −47%**, identical behaviour. Use as the canonical "before/after" for any
new bulkification.

### Reference governor test

`classes/controller/.../ManageItemsControllerGovernorTest.cls` — template
for measuring `Limits.getQueries()`, `getDmlStatements()`, `getDmlRows()`,
`getCpuTime()`, `getHeapSize()` before and after the bulk call. Use as the
template when proving a bulkification win (see Optional Logic below).

---

## Optional Logic

### Prove the win with a governor test

When optimizing an existing hot path, prove the win the same way
`deleteItems` was measured: wrap the call in
`Test.startTest()/stopTest()` and snapshot `Limits.getQueries()`,
`getDmlStatements()`, `getDmlRows()`, `getCpuTime()`, `getHeapSize()`
immediately before and after the call. Expect SOQL/DML counts to become
**flat (constant)** as the input size grows — that flatness is the proof
the rewrite is O(1) and not just "a bit better at N=5".

### Integration with `apex-method-monitor` skill

After bulkifying, run the [[apex-method-monitor]] skill on the rewritten
method to append a fresh row to `docs/apex-method-report.md`. Re-profiling
appends a new dated row rather than overwriting, so the report captures the
before/after trend over time — including CPU and heap, the two limits most
often blown by a regression.

### When to skip

Skip the rewrite only when:

- The operation is genuinely single-record (one id in, one record out, no
  collection input).
- The code is asynchronous Batch Apex (`Database.Batchable`) that already
  chunks by design — its governor limits reset per batch.

Do **not** skip on the basis that "current callers only pass 5 records" —
triggers and future bulk callers will not respect that assumption.
