name: apex-governor-limit-guard
description: >
  Catches Apex that will blow a synchronous governor limit (CPU, SOQL, DML,
  or heap) before it ships. It scans a method for the six common N+1 and
  heap signals — queries inside a loop, DML inside a loop, per-record
  guards and finders (`requireXExists`, `findX`, `getX`) called across a
  collection, parent records fetched per row, and over-wide `SELECT`s on
  large result sets — and flags anything that will fail at real batch size,
  even when it looks fine for 5 records on a developer's machine. The N+1
  is often a loop wrapped around a helper call rather than a visible
  `[SELECT]`, so the scan follows what the loop triggers, not only what it
  shows. If the scan flags the method, the matching rewrite recipe is in
  `apex-bulk-soql`.

  Use this when you are writing or editing an Apex method that touches
  more than one record: anything that takes a `List`/`Set`/`Map` of
  ids/records, contains a `for`/`while` over records, or runs a per-record
  helper on every element. Skip it for genuinely single-record methods
  (one id in, one record out, no collection) and for async Batch Apex
  (`Database.Batchable`), whose governor limits reset per chunk. Do not
  skip on the grounds that "current callers only pass a handful of
  records" — triggers and future bulk callers will not respect that
  assumption.

# Apex Governor Limit Guard

A `LimitException` (CPU, SOQL, DML, or heap) cannot be caught reliably and
aborts the whole transaction. A loop that "works for 5 records" silently
fails the day a real batch — or a trigger firing in bulk — sends 100+. This
guard runs at **write time** because the runtime signal arrives too late: by
the time you see `Apex CPU time limit exceeded` in a debug log, the
transaction has already been rolled back in production.

This is the **detection half** of the bulk-Apex discipline. Its job is to
decide whether a method will breach a governor limit; the actual rewrite
recipe lives in [[apex-bulk-soql]].

---

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Detect the limit-breaking pattern

Before finalizing any Apex method that reads or writes more than one record,
scan it for the signals below. Each signal maps to the governor limit it
will eventually breach. If **any** match, the method must be rewritten via
the [[apex-bulk-soql]] skill:

Scan for the **call**, not just the bracket. A loop body with no visible
`[SELECT]` still costs one query per iteration when it calls a finder or an
existence guard, and that indirect form is the one that slips through review.

| # | Signal | Limit it breaches first | Example |
|---|--------|---|---------|
| 1 | `[SELECT ...]` inside a `for`/`while` loop | SOQL queries (100) + CPU | `for (Id id : ids) { [SELECT ... WHERE Id = :id]; }` |
| 2 | `insert`/`update`/`delete`/`upsert` inside a loop | DML statements (150) + CPU | `for (X__c r : recs) { update r; }` |
| 3 | Per-record guard called per element | SOQL queries (100) + CPU | `for (Id id : ids) { requireXExists(id); }` — one query each |
| 4 | Helper method (`findX`, `getX`, `requireXExists`) called per element | SOQL queries (100) + CPU | `for (X__c r : recs) { findStatus(r.CurrentState__c); }` — one query each |
| 5 | Related/parent records fetched per row | SOQL queries (100) + CPU | `for (X__c r : recs) { findParentById(r.Parent__c); }` |
| 6 | `SELECT` that loads wide rows × large collections without narrowing the field list | Heap size (6 MB) | `[SELECT FIELDS(ALL) FROM X__c WHERE ...]` over thousands of rows |

If none match (e.g. one id in, one record out, narrow field list), the
method is single-record safe — let it through.

A finder that accepts only a single id is itself a signal: a bulk caller has
nothing safe to call, so it gets looped over. Add the `Set<Id>` variant that
returns a `Map<Id, SObject>` rather than looping over the single-id one.

### Step 2 — Verify with the execution checklist

After applying the rewrite from [[apex-bulk-soql]], walk this checklist
before presenting the code. If any row fails, send it back through the
rewrite:

| # | Check | Limit protected | Fix if it fails |
|---|-------|---|-----------------|
| 1 | Any `[SELECT]`, `findX`, or `requireXExists` inside a loop? | SOQL + CPU | Move to one `IN :ids` query → `Map<Id,SObject>`. |
| 2 | Any `insert`/`update`/`delete`/`upsert` inside a loop? | DML + CPU | Accumulate into a `List` and DML once after the loop. |
| 3 | Per-record guard called in a loop? | SOQL + CPU | Replace with a single bulk query + `containsKey` validation. |
| 4 | Related/parent records fetched per row? | SOQL + CPU | Collect parent ids, query once into a map, look up in memory. |
| 5 | Does the SELECT list cover every field used downstream — and nothing more? | SOQL + Heap | Add missing fields so no follow-up query is needed; drop fields that are not read so heap stays bounded. |
| 6 | Same functional behaviour & error messages preserved? | (correctness) | Keep per-id `containsKey` validation for "not found" errors. |

## Resources

### Salesforce synchronous limits (what this guard protects)

| Limit | Sync cap | Failure mode |
|---|---:|---|
| CPU time | 10,000 ms | `Apex CPU time limit exceeded` |
| SOQL queries | 100 | `Too many SOQL queries: 101` |
| DML statements | 150 | `Too many DML statements` |
| Heap size | 6 MB | `Apex heap size too large` |

CPU is the failure mode that bites first in practice: even when SOQL/DML
counts are technically legal, the per-iteration overhead of querying inside
a loop drives CPU past 10,000 ms on real batch sizes. Heap is the quieter
killer — it shows up when a bulk rewrite over-selects fields or holds the
whole result set in memory longer than it needs to.

## Optional Logic

### Do not skip on "current callers only pass 5 records"

Triggers and future bulk callers will not respect that assumption. The only
valid skips are the two listed in the SKIP clause above: genuinely
single-record operations, or asynchronous Batch Apex that already chunks by
design.

### After the rewrite

Once the method passes Step 2, the [[apex-bulk-soql]] skill covers the
measurement step (governor-limit test) and the optional
[[apex-method-monitor]] follow-up that appends a fresh row to
`docs/apex-method-report.md` — including the heap snapshot, so the heap
budget is tracked alongside CPU/SOQL/DML.
